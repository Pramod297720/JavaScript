/* video 3 is all about git and github why we need to understand 
git and github for deloping any project and why we need understand git
for the developing of he project \*/
 
/* what i understood in the video is that we need git to 
- save our project for future use 
-to share our file with other deveoper and work together 
-to see what we have completed in this project and 
who have doen which part 
- to revert any chanegs if any error happen in the github 

not only that i also learn we can use vertual codespace to run the project 
in the git, for that we can do 

run codespace>File>view>command palatte> container add>nodejs or any language which we want
