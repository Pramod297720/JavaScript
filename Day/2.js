// in this section we will learn about thevariable and its type and why it is used

// 1 const 
const name = "Pramod Adhikari";
// const is used so that i do not have to chaneg the variable as we can't chaneg the variable of the code

let phoneNumber=123455;
// we use let to declaret he variable and the variable is change able as when we write 
// let phoneNumber= 123456;
// we can change the varibale and use is it elsewhere 

var sex='male'
// we don't use var in any of the type as its shows error when delcaring scope and what is scope? scope is the declaration mostly used in the fucntion and otehr delcaration 
// such as in if, for or user defined fucntion 

address = "nepal"

//without delcaration aslo we can use the variabel but its aa very bad practice and don't used nowdayd 

console.log([name,address,sex,phoneNumber])
